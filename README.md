Welcome to your small data science challenge! ðŸ‘‹ We're glad that you're willing to invest the time and effort to support your application. Hopefully, finishing this challenge will not take too much time. Once you've finished it, contact us via mail so that we can schedule a meeting to review your results. Thanks for participating and good luck! ðŸ™‚
For both challenges please use Python, as this is the programming language that we use for most applications. There are no restrictions regarding packages, use what you're most familiar with. For your code, please create a Git repository where you push your results (without the data). Share the repository with us so that we can check and eventually discuss your code. Finally, prepare a short summary of your findings (and maybe issues) which you can present within 5 minutes when we meet next. You can use any presentation tool you like (Markdown, PowerPoint, Jupyter Notebook etc.)
