Welcome to your small data science challenge! ðŸ‘‹ We're glad that you're willing to invest the time and effort to support your application. Hopefully, finishing this challenge will not take too much time. Once you've finished it, contact us via mail so that we can schedule a meeting to review your results. Thanks for participating and good luck! ðŸ™‚
For both challenges please use Python, as this is the programming language that we use for most applications. There are no restrictions regarding packages, use what you're most familiar with. For your code, please create a Git repository where you push your results (without the data). Share the repository with us so that we can check and eventually discuss your code. Finally, prepare a short summary of your findings (and maybe issues) which you can present within 5 minutes when we meet next. You can use any presentation tool you like (Markdown, PowerPoint, Jupyter Notebook etc.).

Learning times
In the data provided you find information about the learning progress of some learners on our platform as well as some master data. In this challenge we want to identify whether learners actually spend the estimated duration with their learning materials or whether the actual learning time deviates from our estimates.
1.	Perform a short general analysis of the data at hand to gain a general overview (some KPIs or other useful information about the dataset itself).
2.	Analyze the learning progress of our learners: 
1.	Do actual learning times deviate from our estimated learning times?
2.	Do the results differ between different types or languages of materials?
3.	Can you detect learners who might be "cheating" with their learning progress (i.e., who probably have not been consuming the learning material) from the data?
3.	What other information can you derive from the data?
User classes
In the provided data you find information about some of our users and their skills. The goal of this challenge is to create a useful User class in Python (all the details are up to you). A user object should have (you can add more information if useful)
1.	An identifier so that we can distinguish different users from each other uniquely,
2.	Their skills (you can find them in the data), together with their "mastery" status,
3.	A describe() method which gives a summary of all relevant information about the user.
Once your User class is finished, create a list of all the users and their respective skills from the provided dataset.
